Spool is a game where you can make money by investing wisely.

## How to play

* Start a new game.
* Create a new pool.
* Invest in your pool.
* Convince other players to invest in your pool.
* Win if your pool is the largest at the end of the game.

See [example playthrough](#example-playthrough) for more details.

**Notes:**

* You will **receive 1% of all winnings** if you start a new game & invite other players (no need to win - [learn more](#how-can-i-receive-a-referral-fee)).
* You will **receive a refund** if somebody else invests in your pool (up to the sum of foreign investments - [learn more](#how-can-i-receive-a-refund)).

## Alternative strategy

Instead of creating a new pool, you can invest in somebody else's pool. This strategy works well if you have a small amount of capital. In this case, your playthrough will look like this:

* Join the game.
* Compare the pool sizes.
* Invest in the pool that will be the largest at the end of the game.

You can also speak with pool operators via in-game chat. This will allow you to evaluate the potential of the pool (some players will invest towards the end of the game). 

## Winnings distribution

* Sum the capital of all players.
* Subtract [refunds](#how-can-i-receive-a-refund-of-my-investment), [referrals](#how-can-i-receive-a-referral-fee), [fees](#what-is-the-game-fee).
* Split the remaining sum between investors of the winning pool (according to investor share).

See [example playthrough](#example-playthrough) to learn how much you can win.

## FAQ

### How can I receive a referral fee?

Start a new game to receive 1% of all winnings. 

* No need to win the game.
* No need to join the game (= no need to invest your money).

### How can I receive a refund of my investment?

Convince other players to invest in your pool. If you don't win, you will receive a refund up to the sum they invested in your pool. If you do win, you will receive a refund + winnings.

#### Example #1

* You invest 10 ETH in your pool.
* Bob invests 20 ETH in your pool.

You will receive a 10 ETH refund.

#### Example #2

* You invest 10 ETH in your pool.
* You invest 2 ETH in Alice's pool.
* Bob invest 5 ETH in your pool.

You will receive a 5 ETH refund (up to Bob's investment). 

### What currency can I use for playing?

You can use any ERC20-compatible token: WETH, WBTC, UNI, SUSHI, LINK, COMP, LEND...

Note: the currency is set by the creator of the game before it starts (every player uses the same currency).

### Can I invest in multiple pools?

Yes, you can diversify your investments between multiple pools.

For example: you can invest 30% in Alice's pool, 60% in Bob's pool, 10% in your pool.

### Can I invest 100% in my pool?

Yes, you can. This is the default allocation after you join the game. 

### What happens if I invest in somebody's pool, but he invests in my pool?

Your pool size is determined by the total invested amount. If you invest in somebody else's pool, then your investment is deducted from your pool & added to somebody else's pool.

Example:
* Alice invests 5 ETH in Bob.
* Bob invests 10 ETH in Alice.
* Alice's pool size becomes equal to 10 ETH.
* Bob's pool size becomes equal to 5 ETH.
* Alice wins.

### What is the game fee?

We charge 2.5% of winnings (after [refunds](#how-can-i-receive-a-refund-of-my-investment) and [referrals](#how-can-i-receive-a-referral-fee)).

## Example playthrough

*Alice joins the game with 5 ETH*
*Bob joins the game with 10 ETH*
*Sam joins the game with 7 ETH*
*Joe joins the game with 3 ETH*
*Ted joins the game with 15 ETH*
